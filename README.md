## Project Overview

This project explores how injuries happen during sports from a mechanical perspective. We studied how the body moves, how forces act on joints and muscles, and why certain movements lead to injuries. The goal was to understand how injuries occur, how they can be prevented, and how biomechanics can help athletes recover safely.

## ⚙️ What This Report Covers

The report is divided into the following sections:

### 1. Common Sports Injuries  
A breakdown of four frequent injuries in athletes:
- **ACL tears**
- **Ankle sprains**
- **Hamstring strains**
- **Stress fractures**  

Each injury includes:
- Key anatomy involved  
- How and when the injury usually occurs  
- Visual diagrams for better understanding

---

### 2. Biomechanical Factors Behind Injuries  
We explain how forces, joint positions, muscle imbalances, and repetitive movements increase injury risk. Covered topics:
- Types of mechanical loading (compression, shear, torsion, etc.)
- Muscle strength vs. flexibility issues
- Poor technique or overuse habits
- Acute vs. chronic injury causes

---

### 3. Biomechanical Principles That Matter  
Key mechanical concepts that relate to injury prevention:
- **Force-Velocity Relationship** – how speed affects muscle output
- **Viscoelasticity** – how tendons and ligaments handle stress
- **Joint Kinematics & Kinetics** – joint angles, torques, and how they affect load
- **Ground Reaction Forces** – impact from running, jumping, or landing

---

### 4. Injury Prevention  
The report includes strategies that reduce injury risk:
- Teaching proper landing and movement techniques
- Strength and balance training tailored to sport-specific risks
- Use of appropriate gear (shoes, braces, padding)

---

### 5. Rehabilitation & Return to Play  
We describe how athletes should recover:
- Step-by-step loading to rebuild strength
- Functional movement practice (like sport drills)
- Decision-making based on range of motion, strength, and confidence—not just timelines

---

### 6. New Tools & Technologies  
Emerging ways to improve injury understanding:
- **Wearable sensors** to track movement and loading in real time
- **High-res imaging** to assess internal damage
- **Computer simulations** to model forces and predict risks

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Understanding sports injuries through biomechanics helps coaches, physical therapists, and athletes make smarter decisions. Instead of just reacting to injuries, we can:
- Spot risky movement patterns earlier  
- Train more efficiently  
- Design rehab that actually prepares athletes for return to sport  
- Use technology to reduce guesswork

---

## Tools Used

- 🖥 MATLAB – for modeling forces, simulating motion, and plotting diagrams  
- 📄 Word & PDF – for documentation and visualization  
- 📚 Research papers & medical references – to support explanations

---

## Summary

This report provides a practical and detailed view of how injuries happen in sports. By focusing on body mechanics, we can find ways to reduce risk, guide recovery, and help athletes stay on the field longer and safer.
